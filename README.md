## Fabric Java SDK for IBM Blockchain platform
Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. The Linux Foundationâ€™s Hyperledger Fabric, the software implementation of blockchain IBM is committed to, is a permissioned network. Hyperledger Fabric is a platform for distributed ledger solutions underpinned by a modular architecture delivering high degrees of confidentiality, resiliency, flexibility and scalability.

In a Blockchain solution, the Blockchain network works as a back-end with an application front-end to communicate with the network using a SDK. To set up the communication between front-end and back-end, Hyperledger Fabric community offers a number of SDKs for a wide variety of programming languages. In this tutorial, we will talk about Fabric Java SDK.

It would be helpful for the developers, who started to look into Hyperledger Fabric platform and would like to use Fabric Java SDK and Node SDK for their projects. The SDK helps facilitate Java and Node applications to manage the lifecycle of Hyperledger channels and user chaincode. The SDK also provides a means to execute user chaincode, query blocks and transactions on the channel, and monitor events on the channel. 

Hyperledger fabric network can be provisioned in different ways. Local setup, IBM Blockahain Platform starter plan and IBM Blockchain Platform 2.0. 

This guide provides instructions to use Java and Node client using SDKs to connect to Hyperledger Fabric network provisioned in different ways as mentioned above. This code repository contains folders which are self indicative of the combination and the client SDK and the Fabric network setup. Click on the folder that you want to explore Client SDK operations with Hyperledger Fabric Network.
